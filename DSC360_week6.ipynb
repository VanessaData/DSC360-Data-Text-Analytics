        "# Text Classification on Amazon Alexa Reviews\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "The goal of this project was to classify customer reviews of Amazon Alexa devices as either positive or negative based on the content of their text. The dataset contained various fields like `rating`, `variation`, and `verified_reviews`, but the core focus was on analyzing the `verified_reviews` column. We used natural language processing techniques to preprocess the text data and trained a logistic regression model to predict whether a review was positive (class 1) or negative (class 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Data Preprocessing\n",
        "We began by cleaning the text in the `verified_reviews` column. The preprocessing steps included:\n",
        "- Removing punctuation and special characters.\n",
        "- Converting all text to lowercase.\n",
        "- Removing stop words such as \"and\", \"the\", \"is\" to retain only meaningful words.\n",
        "- Applying lemmatization to reduce words to their base forms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is a sample of the cleaned text:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Original Review | Cleaned Review |\n",
        "| --------------- | -------------- |\n",
        "| \"Love my Echo!\" | \"love my echo\" |\n",
        "| \"Loved it!\" | \"loved it\" |\n",
        "| \"Sometimes while playing a game, you can answer a question correctly but Alexa says you got it wrong and answers the same as you.\" | \"sometimes while playing a game you can answer question correctly alexa says got wrong answers same\" |\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Vectorization\n",
        "After cleaning the text, we transformed the text data into numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization. This step converts the text into a matrix where each row represents a review and each column represents a word from the reviews. The values in the matrix indicate the importance of each word in each review.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Model Building\n",
        "We built a Logistic Regression model to classify the reviews. The model was trained on the vectorized text data and aimed to predict whether a review was positive (class 1) or negative (class 0).\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Model Evaluation\n",
        "The model was evaluated using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Here's a summary of the results:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Accuracy**: 91.43%\n",
        "- **Precision**:\n",
        "    - Class 0: 1.00\n",
        "    - Class 1: 0.91\n",
        "- **Recall**:\n",
        "    - Class 0: 0.07\n",
        "    - Class 1: 1.00\n",
        "- **F1-Score**:\n",
        "    - Class 0: 0.13\n",
        "    - Class 1: 0.95\n",

        "### Conclusion\n",
        "The Logistic Regression model performed well on predicting positive reviews (class 1), but it struggled with negative reviews (class 0) due to the class imbalance. This issue is common when one class has significantly fewer samples than the other. Despite this, the model achieved an overall accuracy of 91.43%, showing that it can effectively classify most reviews as positive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Future Improvements\n",
        "To improve performance, especially on class 0 (negative reviews), we could:\n",
        "- Use **class weighting** in the Logistic Regression model to give more importance to the minority class.\n",
        "- Apply **over-sampling** techniques like SMOTE to increase the number of negative reviews in the training set.\n",
        "- Experiment with other machine learning models such as Random Forest or Support Vector Machines."
